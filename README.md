## Go Octa

Based on the go-ethereum v1.10.17 source code.

## Building the source

![build](https://github.com/octaspace-project/go-octa/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)

Building `geth` requires both a Go (version 1.14 or later) and a C compiler. You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make geth
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```shell
make all
```
